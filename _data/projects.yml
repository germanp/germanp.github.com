    Healthcare management that centralizes the administration of over 20 health centers in the
    city of Buenos Aires. One of the main challenges was handling multi-tenancy as every health
    center has their own database, but there were mixed versions of the software and the data
    schema was different. We had to craft a customization over django rest framework in order
    to handle views with overlapping names (actually with overlapping features).

    It covered the onboarding and off-boarding process of workers under different
    schemas of work. The software handles approving and signing paperwork as well
    the granting of equity.
    One of the challenges was to handle all the different states of the documents
    and approval required. We solved it implementing a state machine with their
    states and transitions.

    Travel tickets and reservation management platform implemented from the ground up
    in *nodeJS*, *express* and *mongodb*. I've took part in the development of the
    frontend for public facing tickets selling.

    The main challenge was to work with a bleeding edge technology like *NuxtJs* is
    and be able to figure out the bases for the rest of the development team. Also,
    handle test automation for almost all the browser was quite challenging.
